      <p className="text-muted-foreground bg-gray-100 p-4 mx-1 rounded-lg shadow-md">I built this web app as a solo developer with a vision to revolutionize education through AI. It is a very basic app that uses AI to generate quizzes from documents, making learning more interactive and efficient. I believe AI has the power to personalize education, automate tedious tasks, and create new opportunities for students and educators alike. This project is just the beginning, and I invite other aspiring developers and innovators to be part of it and help make it something bigger.</p>
